          				<li>The Service consists of the provision by BestFootball to the User of space for the lodging and disclosure of videos displaying football skills.

          		<li>International Users
          			<ol>
          				<li>Acknowledging the global nature of the Internet, the User shall be bound by, and hereby agrees to comply with, in addition to these General terms, the French, European Union and any other laws applicable to them and, in particular, those governing their online behavior and the type of contents they make available, with the consequences herein set forth for the improper use of the Service, or the use thereof in breach of the relevant rules, applying to said Users.</li>

          				<li>BestFootball does claim authorship of the contents lodged therein which may be found in its Users' areas, and the use thereof shall only be admitted with the written authorization of the relevant User. However, by placing their contents on the Platform, the User grants a free, universal and non-exclusive license to BestFootball for the latter to make said contents available to the public with a view to disclosing the same on the Platform or on any other space managed by BestFootball.

          				<li>In case the contents in question are not included within the scope of Clause 5 hereof but, in the sole discretion of BestFootball, they are not consistent with the spirit and image of BestFootball, BestFootball reserves the right to refuse or remove the Service, by means of communication pursuant to Clause 8. To that effect, the mere reference to said Clause shall suffice irrespective of any grounds therefor.</li>
          				<li>The User acknowledges, accepts and authorizes BestFootball to place publicity and/or references to the partners/sponsors over the contents lodged in the Platform by the User, and to that effect the User undertakes to obtain the required authorizations from the holders of any rights over the contents.</li>

          						<li>Then the User fails to observe the terms of use referred to in Clauses 4, 5 and 7 above.</li>
          					</ul>
          				</li>
          				<li>When access to the services is suspended for the reasons described in Clauses 8.3(a) and 8.3(b) above, the User may make another access request in accordance with Clause 4 above.</li>
          				<li>BestFootball shall entirely remove the contents and discontinue all registrations which were not used during a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.</li>
          				<li>The suspension or termination of the Service by BestFootball pursuant to the preceding paragraphs does not entitle the User or any third parties to any indemnification or other compensation, and BestFootball shall neither be responsible nor in any way may it be held liable for any consequence resulting from the suspension, termination or cancellation of the Service.</li>
          				<li>In the situations not referred to in Clauses 5 and 18 of these General Terms, BestFootball shall advise the User in advance, so as to enable them, if they so wish, to safeguard the contents of their area within three (3) business days as from the sending of the email or the posting of information on the homepage of the Service.</li>

To that effect, the User shall contact through the Platform the entity responsible for processing the personal data.</li>

BestFootball may not be held liable for said access or use. On the other hand, by using this Service, whether as User of the space made available or as viewer of contents, it should be stressed that you could be exposed to contents which, contrarily to and irrespective of BestFootball's will, may violate the rules set forth in these General Terms.</li>
